      <h2  class="faqTitle">What is Battle Royale VI?</h2>
      <p> Battle Royale is a LAN party involving various computer games and gaming console tournaments.
        
        Battle Royale will last for a full 25-hours (with Day-Light-Savings Time). The goal of the LAN party is to bring together all the future engineers and computer scientists across the Ottawa Region to share their gaming passion in a relaxed environment.
        
        Hosted on the lovely campus of Carleton University, this event has become an annual tradition for the university students in Ottawa studying not just Engineering and Computer Science, but other discipline as well.
        
        Battle Royale offers a unique opportunity to companies to expose themselves to over a hundred engineering and computer science students from both the University of Ottawa and Carleton University. It had been a huge success over the past years.

      <h2  class="faqTitle">How Does Battle Royale Work?</h2>
      <p> At Battle Royale, if you wish to participate in LAN Games you must bring your own PC/laptop. By buying a ticket you will be given desk space, power and a network to play on for those PC Games.
        
        For console games there will be consoles set up to play on. We do have a collection of consoles however if you would like to volunteer your console for the day it would help increase the amount of games we could run. :) </p>
