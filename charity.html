      <p> This year Battle Royale is giving back by donating all the profits from the event to Child's Play. Child's Play is a community based charity grown and nurtured from the game culture and industry. They have raised over 7 million dollars in donations of toys, games, books and cash for sick kids in children's hospitals across North America and the world have been collected since our inception. Child's Play has been a big supporter of Battle Royale including the local <a href="www.childsplayottawa.com" target="_blank">Ottawa chapter of Child's Play </a> and we thank them.</p>

      <p><strong>Letter of Support from Child's Play</strong>:</p>
      <p>To Whom it May Concern:
        On behalf of Child's Play, I would like to thank the Battle Royale organizers for their hard work in fundraising to provide games, books, and toys to children in hospitals worldwide. Child's Play is fortunate to have incredible community support, and events like this one help fund programs that improve the lives of sick kids every day. We appreciate Gaming Ottowa's fundraising, and hope that you will consider supporting their event.</p>
