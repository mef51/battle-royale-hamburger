                        Many of you have already heard about this, but we would like to bring to everyone's attention that the <a href="http://players.battleroyale.ca/tournaments">Players Portal</a> now features for team management.<br />
                        <br />
                        So, for all of you that are signed up for team-based tournaments, you should now go select your teams.  There are two types of teams: Open and Closed.  <u><strong><em>Open Teams</em></strong></u> are for people who don't have a fully-formed team: others are invited to join.  <u><strong><em>Closed Teams</em></strong></u> are for those that have a complete team and are just waiting for their friends to join.<br />
                        <br />
                        Everyone that wants to play in a tournament that requires teams obviously needs to join a team, and each player needs to make their own team selection invidually.  On Saturday, when Battle Royale starts, those that don't have teams will be put into teams, based on vacant spots on existing teams.<br />
                        <br />
                        Cheers,<br />

                        Hi everyone, the list that you have all be waiting for is now here: the tournaments list. But before we give you the list, we must explain how tournaments will be organized this year. In this year's Battle Royale, we are trying a new tournaments mechanism: we have Major Tournaments, and Crowdsourced Tournaments.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i><u>Major Tournaments</u></i></b> are tournaments that the Battle Royale Organizing Committee will run. These tournaments will have strict schedules, specific rulesets, and large prizes. Your participation in these tournaments is limited by your ticket type: you can join up to the number of tournaments you have purchased. However, if you want to upgrade your ticket type, you can do so at either of the IEEE offices at uOttawa or Carleton, and also at the event itself.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i><u>Crowdsourced Tournaments</u></i></b> are tournaments that will be organized by players themselves. For example, many players will be running various Minecraft servers. These tournaments can be of very casual nature, or serious, but will be organized by the players themselves: it is up to them to arrange the schedules (around the Major Tournaments if they like), choose the rules, and make the bracketing. These tournaments are free to join, no matter which ticket type you have purchased. Initially, these tournaments will not have prizes provided by Battle Royale, but prizes will be assigned to the popular tournaments.
                        <br><br>
                        To manage registrations to Major Tournaments and Crowdsourced Tournaments, we have created a new <b><i><u>Tournament Management System</u></i></b> that allows players that purchased tickets to log in, select their choices of Major Tournaments, and select and create Crowdsourced Tournaments. The system is also used to make seat selections.
                        <br><br>
                        To see the list of tournaments, please go to the <a href="http://players.battleroyale.ca/tournaments">Players Portal</a> for the full list.
                        <br><br>
                        If you have any questions about our tournaments, please post your questions to our Facebook event page.
                        <br><br>
                        Cheers,<br />
