                        Hi everyone, the list that you have all be waiting for is now here: the tournaments list. But before we give you the list, we must explain how tournaments will be organized this year. In this year's Battle Royale, we are trying a new tournaments mechanism: we have Major Tournaments, and Crowdsourced Tournaments.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i><u>Major Tournaments</u></i></b> are tournaments that the Battle Royale Organizing Committee will run. These tournaments will have strict schedules, specific rulesets, and large prizes. Your participation in these tournaments is limited by your ticket type: you can join up to the number of tournaments you have purchased. However, if you want to upgrade your ticket type, you can do so at either of the IEEE offices at uOttawa or Carleton, and also at the event itself.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i><u>Crowdsourced Tournaments</u></i></b> are tournaments that will be organized by players themselves. For example, many players will be running various Minecraft servers. These tournaments can be of very casual nature, or serious, but will be organized by the players themselves: it is up to them to arrange the schedules (around the Major Tournaments if they like), choose the rules, and make the bracketing. These tournaments are free to join, no matter which ticket type you have purchased. Initially, these tournaments will not have prizes provided by Battle Royale, but prizes will be assigned to the popular tournaments.
                        <br><br>
                        To manage registrations to Major Tournaments and Crowdsourced Tournaments, we have created a new <b><i><u>Tournament Management System</u></i></b> that allows players that purchased tickets to log in, select their choices of Major Tournaments, and select and create Crowdsourced Tournaments. The system is also used to make seat selections.
                        <br><br>
                        The beta period of the TMS will begin in the next few days, and those that have already purchased tickets will receive emails with additional instructions. After a week of beta testing, the TMS will go public and everyone will be able to see which tournaments are the most popular, see which tournaments have the biggest prizes, and see how many Crowdsourced Tournaments have been created.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, without further ado, here are the Major Tournaments for Battle Royale VI:
